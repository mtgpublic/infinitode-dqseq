<p align="center" style="font-weight: bold;">A Library/Database of Infinitode Top Dailyquest Bonus Sequence</p>

## 📋︎ Announcement 2025-08-02

Modifitode 1.6.2 has updated its data specifications. From this version onward, the data will be fully compliant with dqseq's standards. The MTG community is currently developing a C++-based sequence traversal project. If progress goes smoothly, dqseq's data source will primarily be provided by this new project.

The MTG community has recently observed frequent occurrences of scores using the Venom FS strategy. dqseq currently has no plans to modify sequence weighting, which means if you wish to employ Venom FS strategies, you'll need to locate sequences yourself.

**Since the game's developer Therainycat has no intention of fixing either the Venom FS strategy exploit or the DQ leaderboard submission exploit, this means the fairness of the DQ leaderboard will be significantly compromised. Please view DQ leaderboard competition with discretion and be prepared for others possessing unfair advantages that cannot be matched through normal gameplay.** While dqseq strives to uphold DQ fairness, MTG has stated it can do nothing about this situation.

## 📌 Description

Infinitode is a tower defense game developed by The Rainy Cat.

Daily quest is a gameplay feature within the game where players need to complete tasks in designated daily levels to earn rewards or achieve high scores to compete on leaderboards. In Daily quest, players can select Bonuses to enhance the strength of their defense towers. By choosing the appropriate path, the best Bonus sequence can be found.

This repository stores a large number of Top Dailyquest Bonus Sequences to help players complete tasks more easily or consistently secure top positions on the leaderboard.

This repository is exclusively published on GitHub and the Infinitode Chinese Community.

The qq group number of Infinitode Milk Tea Group(Infinitode Chinese Community) is 1020322961。

## 🚀 Getting Started

Using the sequence is very simple. Before that, however, make sure you have a good understanding of infinitode daily quests and are clear on the following points.

[Infinitode 2 Wiki - Bonus](https://infinitode-2.fandom.com/wiki/Bonuses) provides a brief introduction to the mechanics of Bonus in Infinitode Dailyquest. Here, the focus will primarily be on the description method of the data.

### Dense Marker Sequence Standard

Use Arabic numerals to describe the sequence, with a space between every five selections. Dense Marker first created this description method, which was then used for community communication sequences.

Encode using a selection record method, describing selection serial numbers from left to right, with the final record index determined by the number of selectable items and whether a reset occurs, with the index starting from 1.

In the current version of Infinitode, without selecting MoreBonusVariantsNextTime, the first item from left to right is 1, the second is 2, the third is 3. In the case of a reroll, the first item is 4, the second is 5, the third is 6.

When selecting MoreBonusVariantsNextTime, the first item from left to right is 1, the second is 2, the third is 3, the fourth is 4. In the case of a reroll, the first item is 5, the second is 6, the third is 7, the fourth is 8.

Example:
```
33513 23432
```

In the provided sequence, assuming there is no MoreBonusVariantsNextTime, the selections are:
- First Group (3, 3, 5, 1, 3):
  - The first two selections are 3 (third bonus).
  - The third selection is 5 (first bonus after a reroll).
  - The fourth selection is 1 (first bonus).
  - The fifth selection is 3 (third bonus).
- Second Group (2, 3, 4, 3, 2):
  - The sixth selection is 2 (second bonus).
  - The seventh selection is 3 (third bonus).
  - The eighth selection is 4 (first bonus after a reroll).
  - The ninth selection is 3 (third bonus).
  - The tenth selection is 2 (second bonus).

### 249 Bonus Model

A score model for evaluating the merits of bonuses, invented by 249.

The score model assumes that every 100 score points double the damage output. In other words, the final damage multiplier x and the score y satisfy the relationship y = 100log2(x) . For example, a score of 230 corresponds to a damage multiplier of approximately 4.925.   

For a sequence of bonuses, the total score is the sum of all selected bonuses’ scores.

### DQ8 Bounty

Bounty upgrades in the core of DQ8 will affect your Bonus. The data will indicate the previous stage of the bounty to assist you in upgrading the core at the right time.

This means you need to complete the previous stage's selection before choosing bounty, and dont't trigger the next stage's selection (fulfilling the enemy kill conditions for the next stage's selection). 

## 🎮 Usage  

If you've gone through the "Quick Start" section, you'll find it easy to grasp how to use the sequences.  

All released data is stored in the `data` directory in txt format, where you can locate sequence data for all stages of the day by date.  

The sequences are already sorted, and generally, the earlier sequences are the stronger ones.  

### Advanced Usage 

The sequences also include summaries, detailed descriptions, scores, and other information to assist in your sequence selection. If needed, please refer to the extended guide below.
