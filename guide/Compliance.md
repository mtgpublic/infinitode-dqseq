# Compliance Troubleshooting

Using sequences within the game is entirely legitimateâ€”in fact, many players are already enjoying the convenience brought by sequences.

## Applicability and Interpretation of Rules

### Official Rules

**Using sequences does not compromise fairness among players.** 
All players can access sequences through the same ways, meaning everyone starts from the same baseline.

- In the official rules section â€” **Our Duties and Responsibilities**, paragraph six, item one states: *Daily quests and levels that disable Research guarantee you a 100% fair competition regardless of your progress.*

**Using sequences is not considered cheating.** 
Using sequences does not send spam data to the server; all requests and data are fully legitimate. Any validations performed after using sequences are properly verified by the server.

- In the official rules section â€” **Our Duties and Responsibilities**, paragraph four, item one states: *Every game replay that gets to the leaderboards is being validated by our servers and it is not possible to cheat anything there. Note: does not apply to third party content, only to those maps / content available by default in our game.* 
  Additionally, item two states: *Default leaderboards, daily quests, regular events and seasonal leaderboards are validated by our servers and are limited by the maxed regular research tree, which should be obtainable in a meaningful time with no in-app purchases.*

- Refer to **Rule #0 - Never Interfere with the Server** in the official rules for the full text.

**Generating sequences is not considered cheating.** 
Sequences are generated using dev mode scripts, which do not send data to the server nor affect personal account information or save files.

### Discord Rules

This refers specifically to **Discord A10 - Cheating in-game / encouragement of cheating** rules, which ensures that you can share sequences and project links on Discord without risking being banned under Discordâ€™s regulations.

**Using sequences is not considered cheating**, and it does not violate Discordâ€™s additional terms.

Under the extended interpretation of Discord A10 by official rules, the following stipulations and moderator clarifications have been added:

* Does not using saves/cloud saves for economic or competitive advantage
* Does not save states in leaderboard runs
* Does not sharing images from modded APKs

**Generating sequences is not considered cheating.** You are allowed to discuss methods of generating sequences in the dev-mode channel on Discord.

### Chinese Community Guidelines

The active members of the Chinese community are primarily MTG members, and some of the administrators are also part of MTG.

Although there is no specific applicable text, **we assure you that you will not face any obstacles from community rules for using sequences. On the contrary, we encourage the use of sequences and welcome contributions to this project.**
