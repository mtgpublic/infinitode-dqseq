Contains historical announcement records.  

## 2025-08-02

Modifitode 1.6.2 has updated its data specifications. From this version onward, the data will be fully compliant with dqseq's standards. The MTG community is currently developing a C++-based sequence traversal project. If progress goes smoothly, dqseq's data source will primarily be provided by this new project.

The MTG community has recently observed frequent occurrences of scores using the Venom FS strategy. dqseq currently has no plans to modify sequence weighting, which means if you wish to employ Venom FS strategies, you'll need to locate sequences yourself.

**Since the game's developer Therainycat has no intention of fixing either the Venom FS strategy exploit or the DQ leaderboard submission exploit, this means the fairness of the DQ leaderboard will be significantly compromised. Please view DQ leaderboard competition with discretion and be prepared for others possessing unfair advantages that cannot be matched through normal gameplay.** While dqseq strives to uphold DQ fairness, MTG has stated it can do nothing about this situation.

## 2025-07-20

**Due to the emergence of more efficient technologies and implementation scripts, as well as the progressive refinement of fairness and anti-cheat declarations, the infinitode-dqseq project has resumed updates. The data is now powered by Modifitode version >=1.6.1.**

**Currently, the data on GitHub has been updated up to August 20, 2025.**

The sequence will currently only be provided in Chinese, and internationalization is not being considered for a considerable period. Internationalization requires a substantial base of in-depth users of infinitode-dqseq, and currently, the project lacks a foundation of non-native Chinese-speaking users. If you are willing to contribute in this regard, feel free to submit suggestions via issues or discuss it in international communities such as the Infinitode Discord.
